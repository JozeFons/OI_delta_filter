# Order_Imbalance

This code will calculate the bid and ask volumes, as well as the delta indicator, for each row in the DataFrame. It will then iterate through the rows and append a trade signal of 1 to the trade_signals list if the ratio of bid volume to ask volume exceeds the threshold and there is a positive delta, a trade signal of -1 if the ratio of ask volume to bid volume exceeds the threshold and there is a negative delta, and a trade signal of 0 otherwise.

It's important to note that this is just a basic example, and you may want to customize the code further to fit your specific trading strategy. For example, you may want to include additional criteria for entering and exiting trades, or use different indicators to determine the order imbalance and filter trades based on delta.
